Getting Started Python setup Requires an installation of Python 3.7+. We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv. These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the Prefect documentation . Installation Install prefect-shell with pip : pip install prefect-shell Write and run a flow from prefect import flow from prefect_shell import shell_run_command @flow def example_shell_run_command_flow (): return shell_run_command ( command = \"ls .\" , return_all = True ) example_shell_run_command_flow () Resources If you encounter and bugs while using prefect-shell , feel free to open an issue in the prefect-shell repository. If you have any questions or issues while using prefect-shell , you can find help in either the Prefect Discourse forum or the Prefect Slack community .
