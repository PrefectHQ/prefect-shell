    Runs arbitrary shell commands.

    Args:
        command: Shell command to be executed; can also be
            provided post-initialization by calling this task instance.
        env: Dictionary of environment variables to use for
            the subprocess; can also be provided at runtime.
        helper_command: String representing a shell command, which
            will be executed prior to the `command` in the same process.
            Can be used to change directories, define helper functions, etc.
            for different commands in a flow.
        shell: Shell to run the command with.
        extension: File extension to be appended to the command to be executed.
        return_all: Whether this task should return all lines of stdout as a list,
            or just the last line as a string.
        stream_level: The logging level of the stream;
            defaults to 20 equivalent to `logging.INFO`.
        encoding: character encoding to use for decoding bytes to strings (defaults to
            ``utf-8``)
        cwd: The working directory context the command will be executed within

    Returns:
        If return all, returns all lines as a list; else the last line as a string.

    Example:
        List contents in the current directory.
        ```python
        from prefect import flow
        from prefect_shell import shell_run_command

        @flow
